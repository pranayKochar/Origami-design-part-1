            <p>Origami is the art of paper folding, which is often associated with Japanese culture.<br>
In modern usage, the word "origami" is used as an inclusive term for all folding practices,<br>
regardless of their culture of origin.The goal is to transform a flat square sheet of paper <br>
into a finished sculpture through folding and sculpting techniques. Modern origami practitioners <br>
generally discourage the use of cuts, glue,or markings on the paper.<p>
